## About Me
My name is Marcus and I am currently a freelance Front End Web Developer.

I am making a transition from teaching chemistry and am seeking fulltime employment.

After teaching myself the fundamental of HTML, CSS and Javascript I moved on to building sites with Gatsby on the front end and pulling data from Sanity on the backend. I have also developed a react native app and used Firebase for user authentication services. 

## Technologies

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript       
* React
* API
* Graphql
* State Context
* Gatsby
* Sanity
* Bootstrap
* Stripe
* React Native


## What I Learned
I think the biggest accomplishment for myself with this project was that I had to go into Gatsby, Sanity and Stripe's documentation and solve my own problems because information and tutorials on the web for these tools is usually spares and or outdated. Also I designed this project from the ground up meaning I used XD to personally design the wireframes and user experience.

Overally I am really happy with the project and I feel that it went a long way towards showing my proficiencies as a well rounded web developer.
	
## What I'm Working On

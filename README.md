## About Me
My name is Marcus and I am a freelance Front End Web Developer.
<details>
I am making a transition from teaching chemistry and am seeking fulltime employment.

I devote the same care and dedication that I showed my students to my code. My background in science education makes me an ideal hire as I am inquisitive, driven, and caring. 

In my free time I focus on getting outside and love going for runs or getting in the ocean.

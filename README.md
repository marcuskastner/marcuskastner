## About Me
My name is Marcus and I am currently a freelance Front End Web Developer.
<details>
I am making a transition from teaching chemistry and am seeking fulltime employment.

After teaching myself the fundamental of HTML, CSS and Javascript I moved on to building sites with Gatsby on the front end and pulling data from Sanity on the backend. I have also developed a react native app and used Firebase for user authentication services.
